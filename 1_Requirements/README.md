# Introduction
It is Seat Heating System,it is capable of maintaining the temperature of the seat in vehicles.In the part of the world ,where temperature is low seat heater is a essential device ,it keeps a person warm.we are using button sensor and a heater switch to sense the presence of the person and the person can vary the temperature to his requirement.The corresponding temperature is displayed.

# Features
* System is able to detect person existance.
* Temperature can be modified.
* System cost is low.
* System is useful for low Temperature Regions.
 # SWOT Analysis
# Strengths
* Easy to Use .
* System cost is low.
* Keep maintain the Temperature.
# Weakness

# How
*  System operates by changing the temperature.


## Details requirements
### High Level Requirements:

1. When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater. | Implemented
2. Next the analog input from the temperature sensor is received and digitized.| Implemented
3. The hard disk must be 4 GB . |	Implemented
4. The web browser must be Microsoft Internet Explorer with a resolution of at least 800 \* 600. |	Implemented

#### Low Level Requirements:

1. The digitized temperature input is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation.| Implemented 
2. The system runs effectively on Windows 2000 server but it will also run equally well on compatible operating systems.  | Implemented
3. The corresponding temperature values based on the digitized temperature input is transmitted by the UART protocol. Here the data is displayed on the serial monitor.| Implemented
